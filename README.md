# Another Purescript React Basic Starter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danieljharvey/another-react-basic-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danieljharvey/another-react-basic-starter)

### What is it?

![Demonstration of app](./static/demo.gif)

### Aims

This is a fairly basic starter for Purescript React Basic with (hopefully) enough features to tinker with and demonstrate that React Basic with Purescript is a pretty OK way to make web apps.

This repository is not an example of idiomatic Purescript development as I would not consider myself experienced enough to really know what that is, however hopefully it should be enough to get an interested beginner on their feet and making/breaking things.

### What is Purescript?

Purescript is a Haskell-esq pure functional language that compiles to Javascript.

### What is React Basic?

React Basic is a set of bindings to React created by [Lumi](https://github.com/lumihq). It contains a number of additional features, most interestingly a reducer-esq way of handling component state ala [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). For more details see the [repo](https://github.com/lumihq/purescript-react-basic) or the [documentation](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-react-basic/6.2.0/docs/React.Basic).

### What else in in here?

As well as the `react-basic` package it uses `affjax` for fetching content, `simple-json` for decoding json data, and `test-unit` for unit tests. You can bin all this other stuff if you like, it is merely there because it is what I prefer.

### Getting Started

Download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/danieljharvey/another-react-basic-starter
```

Change to the exciting new folder you have created.

```bash
cd another-react-basic-starter
```

Install the Javascript dependencies (you can also use `npm` here, your funeral, etc)

```bash
yarn install
```

This will build all of the Purescript in the project (and more importantly, show you any errors)

```bash
yarn purs:build
```

This will run the app on a Parcel server, which you can view by navigating to `localhost:1234` in your browser.

```bash
yarn start
```

Note that Parcel somewhat swallows up your errors - so if you are making changes and not seeing anything - it is good to run `yarn purs:build` to see what's up.

Alternatively, you can run `pscid` in another window, which will show you errors and generally help you out as you develop.

```bash
yarn pscid
```

There are also some basic unit tests you can run with

```bash
yarn test
```

And once you are ready to share your creation with the world, you can make a static version with:

```bash
yarn purs:build
```

### What does all this rubbish do then?

#### Purescript

`purescript` is a Haskell-esq language that compiles to (amongst other things) Javascript.

<http://www.purescript.org/>

#### Psc-package

`psc-package` is a package manager for Purescript which uses sets of packages to ensure everything we use it going to work together. Conceptually it is similar to `Stack` used by Haskell.

<https://github.com/purescript/psc-package>

#### Pulp

`pulp` is a Purescript build tool that does a whole host of good things (and has a nice GIF of Jarvis Cocker dancing on it's github). It is used here for running the unit tests.

<https://github.com/purescript-contrib/pulp>

#### Parcel

`parcel` is a zero-config web app bundler. It is used here to smash everything together and put it in a browser.

<https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel>

#### Test-unit

`test-unit` is a Purescript test runner that let's us do async tests and other good things.

<https://github.com/bodil/purescript-test-unit>

#### Simple-json

`simple-json` is a package for converting to and from JSON, without having to do very much work, which I thoroughly approve of.

<https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-simple-json>

#### Affjax

`affjax` is a Purescript library for making AJAX calls.

<https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-affjax>

#### Pscid

`pscid` is a Purescript file watcher that is pretty handy for checking type errors as you work. I create quite a lot of these so this is pretty essential.

### History

This is a fork of [spacchetti-react-basic-starter](https://github.com/justinwoo/spacchetti-react-basic-starter), which is in turn a fork of the original [LumiHQ/React-Basic-Starter](https://github.com/lumihq/react-basic-starter).

It removes the Nix and Spacchetti stuff (not because that stuff is not great, but I was concerned it may be too many new concepts at once for a beginner) and added a more fully featured sample app to demonstrate that indeed, making (semi) nice things is possible with this setup.
